# Classifying Infected Red Blood Cells
This project classifies different red blood cell images according to whether they are health or at a particular stage of malaria â€” ring, schizont and trophozoite.The data set used consists of 8607 png images of blood cells with corresponding txt files ascertainig whether the particular image is a red blood cell, or at a ring, shizont and trophozoite stage of infection. The data set is too large too upload in this repository and can be accessed [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/exam-deep-learning/train.zip).

## Files Included
| File    | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| train.py |Script for downloading data, training model and running on validation set.|
|mlp_srijon.hdf5| Saved model from training script.|
|predict_srijon.py| Script to predict image labels when provided with a list of image paths. Loads the hdf5 model generated by the training script.|
|sample images| Sample images of each image type|

## Instructions to use:
1. Run training script (train.py) which will download the data and generate a model.
2. Make sure that the directory containing images whose labels are to be predicted is in the same directory as the training (train.py) and predict script (predict_srijon.py).
3. Open the predict_srijon.py script and in the predict function inputs, edit 'list_path' to add the paths for the images that are to be classified. The paths should be separated by commas and added within brackets ('[]').
Example:

```python
def predict(['/home/ubuntu/train/cell_6994.png','/home/ubuntu/train/cell_10338.png'])  # Dummy image paths separated by commas and added within []
```

5. Run the predict script.
